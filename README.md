# AP European History Timeline

The site is being hosted [here](https://timeline.static.domains/).

This was created as my AP European History final project. Coming into this, I had hardly any experience with frontend, and wanted to use this oppportunity to learn more about it while also trying out Dioxus.

It contains a lot of the more important AP Euro events, but definitely doesn't have all of them (I was running out of time to go super in-depth, and it probably wouldn't have looked good anyway).
I let my code get a bit spaghetti, but that's mostly because I didn't have time to rewrite things in a less sloppy way (plus I was still learning).

I disabled the GitHub Pages site because of some issues related to the URL path (which I don't have time to fix), but the branch is still available for the static site files.

### Key Takeaways
- Making a (decently) complex graph with practically no HTML/CSS experience in a framework where (afaik) you can't use existing js libs &mdash; all on a tight deadline &mdash; is probably not the best idea for a final project.
- Procrastinating with the actual content of the project until the last few days, then having to work for ~9 hours straight the day before it is due, is also not a great idea.
- SVG and HTML don't mix very well (CSS works with both though :D)
- Dioxus probably isn't worth using when just implementing frontend &mdash; the fullstack feature eliminates a lot of the boilerplate, but using it for frontend alone just makes the process of developing a UI more complicated.
- Don't do frontend when the school chromebooks have inspect element disabled (especially if you're planning on using WASM).
- CSS is actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.
